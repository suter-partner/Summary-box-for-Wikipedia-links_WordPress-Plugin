== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is no image in a specific summary box? =

Not all, but most, Wikipedia articles contain an image that can be displayed in the summary box. Also make sure that you didn't use the "#dontshowimage" parameter in your Wikipedia link or you have selected "Disable Images" in the administration.

= Why is a particular summary box showing fewer characters than set in the admin? =

The value set in the admin is a maximum. The number of characters displayed in a summary box also depends on the text in the linked Wikipedia article. 

= How do I customize the settings for the summary boxes? =

In your WordPress admin area, navigate to Settings > **Summary for Wikipedia**. There, you can adjust the width, number of characters, font size, disable showing images in all summary boxes, and more.

= I did a change in the settings but it seems not to have an effect. =
